### Testing Steps:

1. **Login to GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com
   - Sign in to your account

2. **Start Keploy Recording**
   - Activate the Chrome extension
   - Begin monitoring API calls

3. **Interact with GitHub Features**
   - Browse your repositories
   - View a repository's issues
   - Check pull requests
   - Search for repositories
   - View user profiles
   - Look at repository insights/stats

4. **Expected API Calls to Capture:**
   ```
   GET /user
   GET /user/repos
   GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}
   GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues
   GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls
   GET /search/repositories?q={query}
   GET /users/{username}
   GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/stats/contributors
   ```

5. **Stop Recording**
   - End the recording session
   - Review all captured interactions

### üì∏ Screenshots to Capture:
- [ ] Extension showing active recording
- [ ] GitHub API calls list
- [ ] Detailed API request headers
- [ ] Response data structure
- [ ] Test generation results

## üåê Step 4: Test Website #3 - News/Social Platform (Optional but Recommended)

### Suggested Options:

#### Option A: Hacker News
- **URL**: https://news.ycombinator.com/
- **API Calls**: Story listings, comments, user profiles

#### Option B: Reddit
- **URL**: https://reddit.com
- **API Calls**: Post feeds, comments, user data

#### Option C: Twitter/X
- **URL**: https://twitter.com
- **API Calls**: Timeline, tweets, user interactions

### Testing Process:
1. Start Keploy recording
2. Browse content, interact with posts
3. View comments, user profiles
4. Search for content
5. Capture various API interactions

## üìã Documentation Requirements

For each website tested, document the following:

### 1. Extension Interface Screenshots
- [ ] Recording in progress indicator
- [ ] Settings/configuration panel
- [ ] API call counter/status

### 2. API Calls Captured
- [ ] Complete list of endpoints
- [ ] HTTP methods used (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Request headers and parameters
- [ ] Response status codes

### 3. Request/Response Details
- [ ] Sample request structure
- [ ] Response data format (JSON, XML, etc.)
- [ ] Authentication methods used
- [ ] Query parameters and body content

### 4. Test Generation
- [ ] Automated test cases created
- [ ] Test coverage summary
- [ ] Success/failure rates
- [ ] Generated test scripts

### 5. Analysis Summary
For each website, include:
- Number of unique API endpoints discovered
- Types of API calls (REST, GraphQL, etc.)
- Authentication mechanisms observed
- Data patterns and structures
- Performance characteristics

## üéØ Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] **Tested at least 2 websites** with different API patterns
- [ ] **Captured meaningful API interactions** (minimum 5 endpoints per site)
- [ ] **Generated automated test cases** using Keploy
- [ ] **Documented with screenshots** showing the complete process
- [ ] **Analyzed API patterns** and documented findings

## üí° Pro Tips for Better Results

### 1. Choose Dynamic Websites
- Look for sites with real-time content updates
- Avoid static websites that don't make API calls
- Social media, news sites, and web apps are ideal

### 2. Interact Thoroughly
- Don't just browse - actively interact
- Use search functions, filters, sorting
- Navigate between different sections
- Trigger various user actions

### 3. Monitor Network Tab
- Keep Chrome DevTools Network tab open
- Compare with Keploy's captured calls
- Verify completeness of capture

### 4. Test Different Scenarios
- Logged in vs. logged out experiences
- Different user roles or permissions
- Various device viewport sizes
- Different content types

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: No API Calls Captured
**Solutions:**
- Ensure website actually makes API calls
- Check if extension has proper permissions
- Try refreshing the page after starting recording
- Look for single-page applications (SPAs)

### Issue: Extension Not Working
**Solutions:**
- Refresh the browser
- Check Chrome extension permissions
- Try incognito mode
- Update Chrome browser

### Issue: Limited API Interactions
**Solutions:**
- Try different user actions
- Navigate to various sections
- Use search/filter functionality
- Check if authentication is required
